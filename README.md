# powerbi_credit_card_project
power bi project analysing credit card transactions and customer data

The data is a sample credit card data of year 2023
Objective: To analyse week wise credit card details
Steps:
    • Database creation in PostgreSQL.
    • The files (customer.csv & credit_card.csv) are copied to the database.
    • In Power BI Desktop, the data is imported from PostgreSQL (SQL Database).
    • New columns (like AgeGroup and IncomeGroup) added.
    • New measures (eg- Revenue) made.
    • Dashboard creation using different charts and KPIs.
    • Drawing insights
Once the basic Dashboard is ready, more data(cust_add & cc_add) can be added using PostgreSQL again and Power BI can be refreshed to add the details of the added weeks to the visuals and be analysed further.
